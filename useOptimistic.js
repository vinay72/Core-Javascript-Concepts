// useOptimistic Hook: The Future of Optimistic UI Updates
// The useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, 
// like a network request, completes.

// useOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you optimistically update the UI.

useOptimistic(state, updateFn) 

// useOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you show a different state while an async action is underway. 
// It accepts some state as an argument and returns a copy of that state that can be different during the duration
//  of an async action such as a network request. You provide a function that takes the current state and the input
//   to the action, and returns the optimistic state to be used while the action is pending.

// This state is called the “optimistic” state because it is usually used to immediately present the user with the
//  result of performing an action, even though the action actually takes time to complete.

import { useOptimistic } from 'react';

function AppContainer() {
  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(
    state,
    // updateFn
    (currentState, optimisticValue) => {
      // merge and return new state
      // with optimistic value
    }
  );
}


Parameters 

// state: the value to be returned initially and whenever no action is pending.

// updateFn(currentState, optimisticValue): a function that takes the current state and the optimistic value passed to 
// addOptimistic and returns the resulting optimistic state. It must be a pure function. updateFn takes in two parameters.
// The currentState and the optimisticValue. The return value will be the merged value of the currentState and 
// optimisticValue.

Returns 

// optimisticState: The resulting optimistic state. It is equal to state unless an action is pending, in which case it 
// is equal to the value returned by updateFn.

// addOptimistic: addOptimistic is the dispatching function to call when you have an optimistic update.
//  It takes one argument, optimisticValue, of any type and will call the updateFn with state and optimisticValue.
