// Promises

// Inversion of Control (IoC) in JavaScript is a design principle where the control of the flow of a program is inverted, meaning that a library, framework, or runtime takes responsibility for handling and managing certain aspects, rather than the developer's code explicitly managing them. This is often achieved through mechanisms like callbacks, Promises, and Dependency Injection.
// Key aspects of IoC in JavaScript:
// Callbacks and Asynchronous Operations:
// In traditional synchronous programming, you explicitly call functions in a specific order. With asynchronous operations and callbacks (like setTimeout, event listeners), you provide a function (the callback) to be executed by another entity (the browser's event loop, a library) at a later time, effectively inverting control over when that specific code runs.


// 1. Before promise we used to depend on callback functions which would result in 1.) Callback Hell (Pyramid of doom) | 2.) Inversion of control
// 2. Inversion of control is overcome by using promise.
//   2.1) A promise is an object that represents eventual completion/failure of an asynchronous operation.
//   2.2) A promise has 3 states: pending | fulfilled | rejected.
//   2.3)  As soon as promise is fulfilled/rejected => It updates the empty object which is assigned undefined in pending state.
//   2.4) A promise resolves only once and it is immutable. 
//   2.5) Using .then() we can control when we call the cb(callback) function.

// 3. To avoid callback hell (Pyramid of doom) => We use promise chaining. This way our code expands vertically instead of horizontally. Chaining is done using '.then()'
// 4. A very common mistake that developers do is not returning a value during chaining of promises. Always remember to return a value. This returned value will be used by the next .then()




// Promises are used to handle async operations in JavaScript.

// We will discuss with code example that how things used to work before Promises and then how it works after Promises

// Suppose, taking an example of E-Commerce

const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

// Below two functions are asynchronous and dependent on each other
const orderId = createOrder(cart);
proceedToPayment(orderId);

// with Callback (Before Promise)
// Below here, it is the responsibility of createOrder function to first create the order then call the callback function
createOrder(cart, function () {
  proceedToPayment(orderId);
});
// Above there is the issue of `Inversion of Control`
// Q: How to fix the above issue?
// A: Using Promise.

// Now, we will make createOrder function return a promise and we will capture that promise into a variable

// Promise is nothing but we can assume it to be empty object with some data value in it, and this data value will hold whatever this createOrder function will return.

// Since createOrder function is an async function and we don't know how much time will it take to finish execution.

// So the moment createOrder will get executed, it will return you a undefined value. Let's say after 5 secs execution finished so now orderId is ready so, it will fill the undefined value with the orderId.

// In short, When createOrder get executed, it immediately returns a promise object with undefined value. then javascript will continue to execute with other lines of code. After sometime when createOrder has finished execution and orderId is ready then that will automatically be assigned to our returned promise which was earlier undefined.

// Q: Question is how we will get to know response is ready?
// A: So, we will attach a callback function to the promise object using then to get triggered automatically when result is ready.

const cart1 = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

const promiseRef = createOrder(cart);
// this promiseRef has access to `then`

// {data: undefined}
// Initially it will be undefined so below code won't trigger
// After some time, when execution has finished and promiseRef has the data then automatically the below line will get triggered.

promiseRef.then(function () {
  proceedToPayment(orderId);
});
// Q: How it is better than callback approach?

// In Earlier solution we used to pass the function and then used to trust the function to execute the callback.

// But with promise, we are attaching a callback function to a promiseObject.

// There is difference between these words, passing a function and attaching a function.

// Promise guarantee, it will callback the attached function once it has the fulfilled data. And it will call it only once. Just once.

// Earlier we talked about promise are object with empty data but that's not entirely true, Promise are much more than that.

// Now let's understand and see a real promise object.

// fetch is a web-api which is utilized to make api call and it returns a promise.

// We will be calling public github api to fetch data https://api.github.com/users/alok722

// We will be calling public github api to fetch data
const URL1= "https://api.github.com/users/alok722";
const user1 = fetch(URL);
// User above will be a promise.
console.log(user); // Promise {<Pending>}

/** OBSERVATIONS:
 * If we will deep dive and see, this `promise` object has 3 things
 * `prototype`, `promiseState` & `promiseResult`
 * & this `promiseResult` is the same data which we talked earlier as data
 * & initially `promiseResult` is `undefined`
 *
 * `promiseResult` will store data returned from API call
 * `promiseState` will tell in which state the promise is currently, initially it will be in `pending` state and later it will become `fulfilled`
 */

/**
 * When above line is executed, `fetch` makes API call and return a `promise` instantly which is in `Pending` state and Javascript doesn't wait to get it `fulfilled`
 * And in next line it console out the `pending promise`.
 * NOTE: chrome browser has some in-consistency, the moment console happens it shows in pending state but if you will expand that it will show fulfilled because chrome updated the log when promise get fulfilled.
 * Once fulfilled data is there in promiseResult and it is inside body in ReadableStream format and there is a way to extract data.
 */
// Now we can attach callback to above response?

Using .then

const URL = "https://api.github.com/users/alok722";
const user = fetch(URL);

user.then(function (data) {
  console.log(data);
});
// And this is how Promise is used.
// It guarantees that it could be resolved only once, either it could be `success` or `failure`
/**
    A Promise is in one of these states:

    pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 */
// 💡Promise Object are immutable.
// -> Once promise is fulfilled and we have data we can pass here and there and we don't have to worry that someone can mutate that data. So over above we can't directly mutate user promise object, we will have to use .then

// Interview Guide
// 💡What is Promise?
// -> Promise object is a placeholder for certain period of time until we receive value from asynchronous operation.

// -> A container for a future value.

// -> A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

// We are now done solving one issue of callback i.e. Inversion of Control

// But there is one more issue, callback hell...

// Callback Hell Example
createOrder(cart, function (orderId) {
  proceedToPayment(orderId, function (paymentInf) {
    showOrderSummary(paymentInf, function (balance) {
      updateWalletBalance(balance);
    });
  });
});
// And now above code is expanding horizontally and this is called pyramid of doom.
// Callback hell is ugly and hard to maintain.

// 💡 Promise fixes this issue too using `Promise Chaining`
// Example Below is a Promise Chaining
createOrder(cart)
  .then(function (orderId) {
    proceedToPayment(orderId);
  })
  .then(function (paymentInf) {
    showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
  })
  .then(function (balance) {
    updateWalletBalance(balance);
  });

// ⚠️ Common PitFall
// We forget to return promise in Promise Chaining
// The idea is promise/data returned from one .then become data for next .then
// So,
createOrder(cart)
  .then(function (orderId) {
    return proceedToPayment(orderId);
  })
  .then(function (paymentInf) {
    return showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
  })
  .then(function (balance) {
    return updateWalletBalance(balance);
  });

// To improve readability you can use arrow function instead of regular function


//A promise is a one-way latch. Once it is resolved with a value or rejected with a reason, its state and value/reason can never change. So, no matter how many times you do .then() on the same promise, you will always get the same result. That's what "immutable" means.



// resolve(val): This seems to refer to a function call where resolve is a function defined within a Promise executor function. When you're creating a Promise, the executor function typically receives two parameters: resolve and reject. These are callback functions provided by the JavaScript runtime to signal the success or failure of the asynchronous operation represented by the Promise. When you call resolve(val), you're essentially fulfilling the Promise with the provided value val. It's commonly used inside a Promise executor function to indicate that the asynchronous operation has succeeded, and the Promise should be resolved with the given value.

// e.g
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Some asynchronous operation
  if (operationSuccessful) {
      resolve(result); // Resolving the Promise with a value
  } else {
      reject(error); // Rejecting the Promise with an error
  }
});

// Promise.resolve(val): This is a static method provided by the Promise object itself. It returns a Promise object that is resolved with the given value val. It's useful when you want to create a Promise that is already resolved with a particular value. This can be handy when you're dealing with asynchronous operations and need to handle values that might be synchronous or asynchronous uniformly.

// Example:
const myPromise1 = Promise.resolve(42); // Creates a Promise resolved with the value 42
