CRN - Content Rendering Path
The content rendering path involves five main steps: HTML parsing to build the DOM, CSS parsing to build the CSSOM,
combining them into a render tree, performing layout to determine size and position, and finally painting the pixels
on the screen. This critical rendering path determines the order in which a browser processes and displays web page
content. 

1. HTML Parsing and DOM Construction

The browser starts by parsing the HTML document. 
It converts the HTML into a tree-like structure called the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the page's structure. 

2. CSS Parsing and CSSOM Construction

During or after HTML parsing, the browser finds and processes CSS. 
It builds the CSS Object Model (CSSOM), which contains the styling rules for the page. 
Note: CSS is "render-blocking" because the browser needs it to style the page correctly. 

3. Render Tree Construction

The browser combines the DOM and the CSSOM to create the render tree. 
This tree contains only the elements that will be visible on the screen, including their computed styles. Elements like <head> or those with display: none are excluded. 

4. Layout

The browser calculates the exact size and position of each element in the render tree. 
This step determines the layout of every visible element, finding its place on the page. 

5. Painting

The browser paints the actual pixels on the screen based on the render tree and layout information. 
This process involves drawing the different layers of the page, including text, colors, and images, to the screen.
