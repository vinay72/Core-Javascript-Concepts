// Event delegation is based upon event bubbling


// instead of attaching event handlers to each and every child elements or the html elements 
// individually, we should rather attach a event handler to directly parent of these elements,
// we will try to attach a single event listener to the parent id.
// Now when anyone clicks on child event handlers, event will eventually bubbles out to their parent,
// and event handler would be triggered and callback function would be called  
// Now all of the child events are propagated up the hierarchy and the parent event handler is 
// listening to all the child event handlers.

// This is what Event Delegation is.

        window.location.href = '/' + e.target.id
    }
