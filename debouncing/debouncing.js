// debouncing in javascript

// Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time.
// When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called.
// You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before â€” when entering an elevator. 
// Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button (the debounced function not being called) will the elevator door actually close (the callback function is executed).
