<!-- Event bubbling -->
 <!-- When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.
Let’s say we have 3 nested elements FORM > DIV > P with a handler on each of them: -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    body * {
      margin: 10px;
      border: 1px solid blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <form onclick="alert('form')">FORM
    <div onclick="alert('div')">DIV
      <p onclick="alert('p')">P</p>
    </div>
  </form>
</body>
</html>

<!-- A click on the inner <p> first runs onclick:

On that <p>.
Then on the outer <div>.
Then on the outer <form>.
And so on upwards till the document object -->

<!-- So if we click on <p>, then we’ll see 3 alerts: p → div → form.

The process is called “bubbling”, because events “bubble” from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water -->

<!-- What Happens When You Click on <p>:

When you click on the <p> element:

The onclick for <p> runs → alert 'p'

Then the event bubbles up to the parent <div> → alert 'div'

Then it bubbles up again to the <form> → alert 'form'

So you’ll see three alerts in order: -->
<!-- p
div
form -->
